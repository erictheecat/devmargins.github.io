### [How to Stay Ahead of the Curve When Working with AI as a Software Engineer](/posts/2026-02-05-how-to-stay-ahead-of-the-curve-when-working-with-ai-as-a-software-engineer/)
<small>February 5, 2026</small>

The landscape of software engineering has shifted dramatically over the past year. AI-assisted coding has moved from experimental to essential, and engineers who adapt their workflow will outpace those who don't.

But here's the thing: using AI effectively isn't about faster typing or more lines of code. It's about knowing when to use it, how to verify it, and what skills remain valuable.

### [When NOT to Use AI for Coding](/posts/2026-02-05-when-not-to-use-ai-for-coding/)
<small>February 5, 2026</small>

AI coding assistants have become indispensable. They generate boilerplate, suggest refactorings, and speed up routine tasks. But there's a dangerous assumption creeping into engineering culture: that AI should be the default for everything.

This post provides practical guidance on five areas where engineers should avoid or limit AI usage: security-critical code, performance-critical paths, domain-specific business logic, novel algorithms, and when you lack domain expertise.

## About

DevMargins is a blog focused on structural insights about AI-assisted development, avoiding hype, and identifying what's actually worth your attention.

**No fluff. No emojis. No "game-changing" nonsense.** Just honest observations about tools and workflows that shape how we write software today.

## Philosophy

### What we believe:

- **Observational > argumentative** — We point out systems and failure modes, not dunk on individuals
- **Structural > hot takes** — Insights that age well in 6 months or we don't publish them
- **Operator-first** — Written for people building things, not talking about building things
- **Credibility > engagement** — We'd rather be right than viral

### What we cover:

- AI coding tools and their real tradeoffs
- Development workflows that actually work
- Supply chain and security in AI era
- Structural issues in how we build software
